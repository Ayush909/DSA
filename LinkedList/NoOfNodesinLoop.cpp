/*Approach: It is known that Floydâ€™s Cycle detection algorithm terminates when fast 
and slow pointers meet at a common point. It is also known that this common point is
one of the loop nodes. Store the address of this common point in a pointer variable say (ptr).
Then initialize a counter with 1 and start from the common point and keeps on visiting the next node 
and increasing the counter till the common pointer is reached again.
At that point, the value of the counter will be equal to the length of the loop.
